# 👋 Hi, I’m Aniket Surve

I’m a **Senior Data Engineer** with **9+ years of experience** building scalable, reliable, and cloud‑native data platforms. I enjoy turning messy, high‑volume data into clean, analytics‑ready assets that actually help businesses make decisions.

I currently work across **AWS and Azure**, designing end‑to‑end data pipelines, modern lakehouse architectures, and performance‑optimized analytics solutions.

## 🚀 What I Do

* Design and build **large‑scale data pipelines** (batch & streaming)
* Work with **big data and lakehouse technologies**
* Optimize data models and queries for **performance and cost**
* Collaborate closely with analytics, product, and business teams
* Write clean, maintainable, production‑ready code
